            Out of an abundance of caution for the health and safety of our
            loved ones, we have made the difficult decision to adjust our
            wedding plans.
            <br></br>
            We will be holding an intimate ceremony with our immediate family
            and wedding party on our original September date.
          </p>
          <p>
            We still want to dance with you all, and so we are looking forward
            to celebrating our marriage with you at our reception on April 30,
            2021.
            <br></br>
            Interesting times lead to creative solutions, so we thank you all
            for your understanding.
          </p>
