        Out of an abundance of caution for the health and safety of our loved ones,
        we have made the difficult decision to adjust our wedding plans.
        <br></br>
        We will be holding an intimate ceremony with our immediate family and
        wedding party on our original September date.
      </p>
      <p>
        We still want to dance with you all, and so we are looking
        forward to celebrating our marriage with you at our reception on April 30, 2021.
        <br></br>
        Interesting times lead to creative solutions, so we thank you all for your
        understanding.
